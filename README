# P VS PI vs PD vs PID Controller Family Comparison

This project analyzes and compares 5 controller gain combinations of different controllers.

## 📌 Overview

We evaluate controller performance across multiple gain configurations by analyzing:

- Rise time
- Overshoot
- Oscillation
- Steady-state error
- Stability

The goal is to observe how increasing integral gain (PI) affects stability and how derivative action (PID) improves damping.


## 🔎 Observations

- Increasing Ki reduces steady-state error but increases oscillations.
- PID controllers allow higher gains while maintaining stability.
- Derivative action significantly reduces overshoot.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
